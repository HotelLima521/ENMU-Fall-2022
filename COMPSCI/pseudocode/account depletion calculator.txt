// Inputs
int starting_balance = 10000
float balance_and_interest
float interest = 0.5 // per month interest, or 6%/year
int monthly_withdrawal = 500

// Outputs
int i = 0

// Algorithm

// Multiply starting balance by interest and subtract from monthly withdrawal. This should be lower than the actual monthly_withdrawal. Write a loop to continue this process until starting_balance is depleted.

while starting_balance > 0:
	balance_and_interest = starting_balance*(1+interest/100)
	balance_and_interest - monthly_withdrawal
	starting_balance = balance_and_interest
	i++

return "The amount of years it takes to pay off this balance is: " i/12
