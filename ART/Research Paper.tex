\title{Research Paper}
% A four (not 3 1/2) page research paper that is focused on anything or anyone that YOU can
% relate to rock & roll. It can be the typical round up of an artist or band and what they
% have accomplished, like Elvis, or the Beatles, or Woodstock. You can make it easy, but there is
% a catch. There is always a catch isn't there? For the first time ever I am running submissions
% through UniCheck or what ever the Canvas version of "Turn it In" is. That means that the
% typical, easy, everyone has done the same topic to death paper is more likely to pop up with
% duplicated sources and phrasing, i.e. plagiarism. Damn technology. Pick something that is
% interesting to you and make it creative. I suggest investigating how a particular technology
% has impacted Rock & Roll, or drugs, or politics, or changes in society.
%
% Here's the nitty gritty: 4 pages, double spaced. No funky fonts or fudging the margins to
% fluff out the paper. I expect in-text citations as well as a reference page or works cited
% page following the paper. A minimum of 5 good sources. Don't cite Wikipedia as a good source.
% Use Wikipedia to FIND a good source. You can use MLA, APA, or Chicago-style format.
% If you are unfamiliar with how to write a research paper in one of these formats, Google it
% or pick up a style guide. That being said, my focus is less on format and more on content.
% I'm not going to pick you apart on small details.
%
% I advise not putting this assignment off until the end of the semester, but you are going to,
% aren't you? Yeah, I know. Don't say I didn't warn you. Upload a copy of your Word document
% to this assignment. Don't send it to me through the ENMU email swamp unless you are 
% really desperate.
