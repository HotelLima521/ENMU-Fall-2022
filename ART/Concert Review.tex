\title{Concert Review}
% These are easy points. Attend a live music performance in person or find something on YouTube.
% Based on your perspective and opinion describe the performance and any connections you may have
% noticed to Rock & Roll. ANY music performance will do. Pro concert, campus recital,
% street busker, church choir, your cousins garage band, even a freaking karaoke performance
% will work. Give a 1 page description of your thoughts. Easy points if you do it.
% A missed letter grade if you blow it off. Again, upload your Word document file here and
% not my email.
